# System Maintenance Utility 

The provided script is a batch file designed to perform a comprehensive system maintenance routine on a Windows computer. It begins by logging its initiation into a designated log file and resets various network settings using a series of ipconfig and netsh commands to release, renew, and flush DNS settings, among other actions. The script also disables network interfaces temporarily. Subsequently, it stops specific services and kills unnecessary processes to free up resources. It manages temporary files by deleting them from several locations to clear up disk space. After cleaning, it re-enables the network interfaces and restarts a list of services to ensure the system's functionality is restored. Additionally, the script restarts the computer's GPU and other critical programs that were closed during the maintenance process. Finally, it restarts the Windows Explorer process to refresh the user's desktop environment and logs the completion of maintenance tasks.
